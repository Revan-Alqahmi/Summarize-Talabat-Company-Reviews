# Summarize-Talabat-Company-Reviews-

This is my project in the Natural Language Processing course.

In today's business scene, understanding customer needs is of utmost importance for companies like Talabat to improve their services. However, manually reviewing a large number of customer comments can be time-consuming and expensive, resulting in delays in implementing improvements and customer dissatisfaction.

To address this challenge, my team and I propose leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to develop software that efficiently classifies customer reviews. This software will identify positive and negative feedback, enabling the company to address issues promptly and retain satisfied customers.

By employing NLP techniques, Talabat can gain valuable insights into customer preferences and enhance its services. The outcome of our project is a software solution based on NLP that effectively processes and classifies customer reviews for Talabat Company.
