# Summarize-Talabat-Company-Reviews

This is my project in the Natural Language Processing course in UQU.

In today's business scene, understanding customer needs is of utmost importance for companies like Talabat to improve their services. However, manually reviewing a large number of customer comments can be time-consuming and expensive, resulting in delays in implementing improvements and customer dissatisfaction.

To address this challenge, my team and I propose leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) to develop software that efficiently classifies customer reviews. This software will identify positive and negative feedback, enabling the company to address issues promptly and retain satisfied customers.

The outcome is a Python-based software solution that utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning algorithms to effectively analize and classify customer reviews for Talabat Company with an accuracy of approximately 86%.
